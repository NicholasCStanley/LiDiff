## Usage

### Training with Improved Model
```bash
python lidiff/train_improved.py --config lidiff/config/config_improved.yaml
```

### Using Original Model with Fixes
```bash
python lidiff/train.py --config lidiff/config/config.yaml
```

### Key Configuration Options
- `diff.scheduler_type`: Choose from ddpm, ddim, dpm, euler, etc.
- `train.precision`: Use '16-mixed' for faster training
